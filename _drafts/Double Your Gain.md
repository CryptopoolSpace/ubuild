_Battle-hardened by 16 months of big challenges and now finally ready to launch one of its asset “MainNet Pricing Lock” on 30th November to End of January 2020, Cryptopool is finally on track to realize the promise of an industry-changing idea. Read here some of the trials and challenges along the way and why I remain a firm believer that CXP has huge upside potential for those willing to stay the course. Luke Green explains…_

# A Long, Eventful Road for CXP

_For those of you who have been around a while, you’ll know that getting to this point has been a very eventful journey for CryptoPool. The twists and turns, and highs and lows have perhaps tested the patience and resolve of even the most ardent enthusiasts._

_But should we be surprised? Some would argue not. Innovation is hard, it requires focus, agility and, in some cases, flying in the face of strong prevailing winds._

_CryptoPool Chain is unique for a number of reasons–not least of all because it has been forged almost entirely in the public eye. It has created a strong demand in advance of its platform and, as a result, we have all been invited to take part in the initial stages of a tech company. Unlike we’d all like to imagine there isn’t a straight line to success and beyond. It’s often a very haphazard experience of trial and error that many rarely see or experience._

_While it seems counter-intuitive, failure and specifically how a company reacts to it, is in many respects, what shapes and defines it. As CryptoPool price has mentioned, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” With two of its asset very public launch delays, CXP has been tested with its fair share of setbacks. These have been tough for all involved but they have also defined the decisions that led to the news that the new “MainNet Pricing Lock” will launch on 30th November to End of January 2020._

# A Mixed Reaction

_While this news is extremely bullish long term for the project, there has been a very mixed reaction from the market reflected in the CryptoPool price. For some holders, both the date and the fact that it’s only a “MainNet Pricing Lock” release have been a disappointment. In part, this is perhaps due to some optimism that the Russian Gnosis Code would provide more of a timeline advantage and, rather than a MainNet Pricing Lock, we’d be gunning for a MainNet live platform._

_However, via each of the methodical One of The finest **DEVELOPERS** updates, it has become clear that there have been some big engineering and mathematical challenges to solve with the original work. Understandably given the timing of their entry to the project, They has remained very cautious and clearly wants to improve on previous expectations management._

_With that in mind, the fact the team has recently provided dates can be read as a very good sign. It suggests that the biggest engineering challenges are now behind them, allowing them to focus on build-out and beta-testing._

# A Phase of Consolidation

_When it comes to creating excitement around CryptoPool Chain, CryptoPool price has clearly delivered. Just a cursory glance back through the update on YouTube channel will reveal a CEO who is just as passionate as he is transparent about the project. However, through his own admission, this enthusiasm and transparency have led to mistakes._

_As a result, the market quite rightly wants to see clear evidence of progress and finds himself having to traverse a long period of development consolidation, with two launch delays hanging over him. As we move through this period (which is more about the technical details than exciting marketing tactics), we are seeing an understandably buttoned-down CEO having to bite his lip._

_He naturally wants to rev up promotional plans or show us what the new Developer has been building. But he knows the project is under a great deal of scrutiny from both holders and the wider industry and it’s important to get this right._

_Depending on your appetite for risk, this presents a number of scenarios. You could see it as the perfect time to sit on the sidelines or like many holders have concluded, a fantastic opportunity to accumulate more CXP tokens. Whatever your position, you can be sure the moment Gartner is given the green light by Tigerfx Development Team with a product to promote, things are going to get pretty exciting very quickly!_

# The Next Key Moments

_For both investors and long term holders, it’s clear that CryptoPool Chain has a few very key moments ahead of it. Especially given that there is much to prove due to the historical delays. As a result, here are a few aspects I’ll be keeping an eye out for that could rapidly and positively affect sentiment._

_Dev is due to write up the work they have been doing to date this week; expect this to add further evidence that shows the platform is finally on track._

_While we know the launch date of the MainNet Pricing Lock, any evidence (screenshots/video demos) of the platform in the meantime could see a dramatic uptick in project interest._

_News of the first testers being let into the platform will also be a big indicator of platform development progress._

_The “MainNet Pricing Lock”might occur earlier than expected – don’t bet on it – but if it does it will be a great sign for the market and CXP price._

# Summing Up

_There’s no mistake, CryptoPool Chain has everything to prove right now especially while there remains uncertainty around some of the key features like the practicalities of the peg system. However, with effective and talented developers on board, it’s clear to see that Gartner and his team have the opportunity to start providing consistent and realistic feature updates and continue to return confidence to the project._

_As further evidence builds that the project is on course, it seems it’s only a matter of time that, yet again, CXP will be building up a serious head of steam. When you factor in that a go-live date could be less than six months away, with perhaps some surprises along the way, there’s no way I’ll be doing anything but adding to my position._
